# Find-Number
This program is created as part of learning and practicing the C language.
The project encompasses various aspects of the C language. Through this program, a game called "Guess the Number" has been created, where a random number is generated, and the player tries to guess it. At the end of the game, when the player has found the number, a message is displayed on the screen indicating how many attempts it took to find the correct number.
